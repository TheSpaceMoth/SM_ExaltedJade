  <description>This mod is inspired by the WhiteWolf game system Exalted, adding additional colours of Jade, to make 6 colours total.
Each colour of Jade is associated with a different element aspect.

This mod also supports Vanilla Textures Expanded!

In the future the different colours of Jade will have different properties or Ideology bonuses however this has not yet been implemented.
Yellow Jade is rarer and more valuable as a result.
